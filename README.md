# SQA_Example

Product Details: 
A fitness product that allows you to set a route on Google Maps. It then generates a video that will play through, depending on how far you move or cycle in a physical space.


Choose a role for each team member. 
The role each person has gives them the final word on stack items related to their role. (A Developer will make a final choice between Node and Java on the backend but everyoneâ€™s ideas are welcome).

Discuss as a group what STACK you would like to use.
Example:
Node on the backend
React on the frontend
React Native for the mobile apps
Jest and React Testing Library for testing
Postgres for database
github and git for version control and collaboration
Github actions for continuous integration
Netlify to deploy front
Heroku to deploy back
Storybook for component testing
etc.

Justify your stack in your presentation or in the README of your github repo

Define some of the process, you can even start the project set up or write some initial code and tests that you can demonstrate to show code review and test settings. Linter rules etc.

Set it up and/or describe as if it was a real project but we won't build it fully, we will just discuss how SQA fits into the overall project building scheme
